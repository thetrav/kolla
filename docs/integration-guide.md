# Integrating with Kolla

This guide describes how to integrate with Kolla.  The main integration path is
via docker-compose using docker-compose YML files.  Each container set has a
common YML and associated openstack.env.  The openstack.env file describes the
command line environment to pass to the docker-compose yml files.

## Why integate with Kolla?

Integrating with Kolla takes a hard part of managing an OpenStack system,
specifically managing the container images, and places the burden on a third
party project.  We strive to do an excellent job of providing world-class
OpenStack containers at least as a reference architecture, and possibly as what
may be desireable to deploy into live production.

## Docker Command Line Arguments

Every container set YML file includes the necessary docker CLI operations
needed to launch the container in a tidy YML file.  Instead of guessing which
set of command line operations are needed per container, the docker-compose
YML file can be used directly and will pass the appropriate command line
values to the container on container start.

The parameterized docker features used by kolla are:

* --pid=host
* --net=host
* -v host:container
* --privileged

These parameterized features are not exposed to the user.  Instead they are
executed via docker-compose.

## Environment Variables

Rather then document which individual containers require specific configuration
variables, Kolla integration requires passing all configuration variables to
all containers.  This allows a simple method of ensuring every type of node
(controller, storage, compute) recieves the same configuration.

### Environment Variable KEY/VALUE pairs

ADMIN_TENANT_NAME=<admin> - tenant name
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<mysql root password> - defines the MYSQL root password

arn't these two the same?
NOVA_EC2_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> _ The IP Address wher ethe Nova EC2 service is hosted
NOVA_KEYSTONE_PASSWORD=<password> - The Nova keystone password
NOVA_KEYSTONE_USER=<nova> - The Nova keystone username
PUBLIC_INTERFACE=<eth1> - The nova public interface
PUBLIC_IP=<Host IP Address> - The IP Address of this host
RABBITMQ_PASS=<rabbit> - The rabbitmq password used to join AMQP
RABBITMQ_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - The IP Address where the Rabbit service is running
RABBITMQ_USER=<rabbit> - The RabbitMQ user name
RABBIT_PASSWORD=<password> - The RabbitMQ password
RABBIT_USERID=<rabbit> - The RabbitMQ user id on the host


## Launching a container set

Pick out a simple container set and launch it as follows:

docker-compose -f compose/rabbitmq.yml up -d

The third party deployment engine should launch the appropriate containers for
the appropriate nodes.  Note the rabbitmq.yml used in the example above expects
an openstack.env file present in the current working directory.  This file will
be passed as environment data to the container and configure the container
appropriately.


# Conclusion

Integrating with Kolla is as sample as creating an openstack.env file, having
a deployment tool write the openstack.env file and .yml files to the nodes
are targeted for deployment, and running docker-compose as described in the
above documentation.
